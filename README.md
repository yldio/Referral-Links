# Referral Links

What it says on the tin ðŸ˜„ Share referral links with colleagues so when switching broadband/energy etc. we can all benefit

## Using links
Use the link from the top of the table, and once used add a âœ… in the used column.

Always go for the link with the fewest âœ…'s (as long as it's the provider you want!)

## Add yours!
To add your own, add your name and link to the bottom of a table.

If there's no file, feel free to add a <Service>.md and create a table with your info there!
